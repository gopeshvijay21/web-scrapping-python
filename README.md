# web-scrapping-python

The is made possible using the Beautiful Soup package from python which is used for parsing HTML and XML format.

The work is still on as When I try to open the file in excel I am faced with the below error:

"Rankings.csv" is locked for editing by 'another' user.

I tried doing every thing like closed the file from python by using 'with' keyword and also deleted the file object from the heap. But nothing happened. I will try keep searching for this and update this thread if I fing something.

Few important urls that can be studied as part of this:
